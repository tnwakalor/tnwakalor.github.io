                    This is a website that showcases information about Bob Saget, an american stand-up comedian. 
                    The site advertises one of his recently published books for purchase and gives us news about his most recent tour 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Contrast: The relevant content does not stand out really.
                            The Location of certain elements like the menu is awful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repetition: There's barely any repetition with the layouts, fonts, sizing of elements etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alignment: This is where this website fails the most. The alignment with most of the elements are terrible.
                            Super inconsistent. Makes the site look disorganized.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proximity: Related elements are barely grouped together as it is hard to identify what content he was trying to display.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
